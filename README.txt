How to Play:

	Move your muncher in front of an item. If the
	item is the same color as you, it will disappear
	along with all other identical items touching it.
	If not, it will mutate into the color you are and
	your color will change to the color it was. The
	goal is to clear out all the items. If you eat the
	last item of a particular kind, you will turn into
	a color of a random item that is remaining.

	1 Player - SURVIVAL MODE:
	Items will replenish at the top of the screen.
	You must clear out all items before you get
	crushed at the bottom. 
	TIP: try to eat all the items of one color so
	that the new items at the top are less diverse
	and easier to clear out
	
	1 Player - CLEAR MODE:
	No items are falling. Just try to clear them out!
	
	2 Player - Co-op:
	Two players on one wide screen. Otherwise same
	as SURVIVAL MODE.
	
	2 Player - Vs:
	Two players playing against each other. If you
	clear out the items first, you win! If you get
	crushed at the bottom, the other player wins.
	
	2 Player - Race:
	The first player to eat the magic block in the
	center of the screen is the winner.

Input:
	All keys can be configured from the input
	configuration screen.

	The Input Configuration Screen requires you
	to use the mouse to pick keys.
	
	By default:
	
	Menu Navigation: Arrow Keys and Space/Enter

	Player 1: WASD to move and TAB to eat
	
	Player 2: Arrow Keys to move and PERIOD to eat
	
	Note: for 1 player games, all the above input
	is merged so you can use any of these methods
	to play. (but JUST for 1 player games)
